## Get data 
Note: make sure data is in its own folder named "data"
```{r}
l = list()
for (season in c(2007:2022)) {
  l = l %>% append(list(readRDS(paste0('./data/shot_data_', season, '.rds'))))
}

df = bind_rows(l)

rm(l)
```


Data cleaning
```{r}
# Make sure 0 distance shots are from restricted area
df = df[df$SHOT_ZONE_BASIC == 'Restricted Area' | df$SHOT_DISTANCE > 0, ]

# Make sure 3 pointers fall under appropriate category
df = df[!(df$SHOT_TYPE == '3PT Field Goal' & 
            df$SHOT_ZONE_BASIC %in% c('In The Paint (Non-RA)', 'Mid-Range', 
                                      'Restricted Area')), ]

# Make sure 2 pointers fall under appropriate category
df = df[!(df$SHOT_TYPE == '2PT Field Goal' & 
            df$SHOT_ZONE_BASIC %in% c('Left Corner 3', 'Right Corner 3', 
                                     'Above the Break 3', 'Backcourt')), ]
